# Where To

## Overview

Where To allows users understand and visualise the culture of cities around the world. The data gathered from the Meetup API has been used to determine the relative importance of each of the 33 categories, based on the number of groups in each city. This provides users with meaningful information regarding the cities they are most likely to find people with a common interest.

## Technologies used

1. Ruby on Rails
2. JavaScript, including the following libraries:
  - [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)
  - [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
  - jQuery
  - Ajax
3. Meetup API
4. PostgreSQL
5. HTML5
6. CSS3
7. Heroku hosting

## Key features

- Users select a category they are interested in and are shown a bar chart with the top 10 cities for which there are groups relevant to that category
- Users are shown a doughnut chart displaying the proportion of groups in the selected category compared to total groups (the chart also displays the slice-up of each of the 33 categories in that city)
- Users can compare city culture information with another city
- Users can select a city on the map and be directed to the relevant city's Meetup.com page

## Features to be added

- Make cities on the map clickable to display city culture information to the user
